            <p>There are a good many applications that will get you up and running with Sass in a few minutes for Mac,
                Windows, and Linux. You can download most of the applications for free but a few of them are paid apps
                (and totally worth it).
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>CodeKit (Paid) Mac</li>
                <li>Prepros (Paid) Mac Windows Linux</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Libraries</h2>

            <p>
                The Sass team maintains two Node.js packages for Sass, both of which support the standard JavaScript
                API. The sass package is pure JavaScript, which is a little slower but can be installed on all platforms
                Node.js supports. The sass-embedded package wraps a JS API around the Dart VM, so it’s faster but only
                supports Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are also community-maintained wrappers for the following languages:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Ruby</li>
                <li>Swift</li>
                <li>Java, including:</li>
                <li>A Gradle plugin.</li>
                <li>A lightweight Maven plugin wrapping the Sass CLI. It specifies the Sass version to use. The CLI
                    arguments are passed-in with an list.</li>
                <li>A batteries-included Maven plugin wrapping Dart Sass. It bundles a fixed dart-sass version. The CLI
                    arguments are exposed as Maven parameters.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Command Line</h2>

            <img src="https://sass-lang.com/assets/img/illustrations/keyboard.svg" alt="" width="320" height="320">

            <p>
                When you install Sass on the command line, you’ll be able to run the sass executable to compile .sass
                and .scss files to .css files. For example:
            </p>

            <p class="box-model">
                sass source/stylesheets/index.scss build/stylesheets/index.css
            </p>

            <p>
                First install Sass using one of the options below, then run sass --version to be sure it installed
                correctly. If it did, this will include 1.66.1. You can also run sass --help for more information about
                the command-line interface.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once it’s all set up, go and play. If you’re brand new to Sass we’ve set up some resources to help you
                learn pretty darn quick.

            <p>
                You can install Sass on Windows, Mac, or Linux by downloading the package for your operating system from
                GitHub and adding it to your PATH. That’s all—there are no external dependencies and nothing else you
                need to install.
            </p>

            <h4>
                Install Anywhere (npm)
            </h4>

            <p>
                If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running
            </p>

            <p class="box-model">
                npm install -g sass
            </p>

            <p>
                However, please note that this will install the pure JavaScript implementation of Sass, which runs
                somewhat slower than the other options listed here. But it has the same interface, so it’ll be easy to
                swap in another implementation later if you need a bit more speed!
            </p>

            <p>
                If you use the Chocolatey package manager for Windows, you can install Dart Sass by running

            <p class="box-model">
                choco install sass
