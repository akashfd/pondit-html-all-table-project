    <p> A journey by bus is really interesting and thrilling. Last summer, I had the chance to make a journey by bus.
        My two bosom friends were with me. I enjoyed it a lot. One of my friends invited us to his Barishal home.
        We three friends agreed to go. On a fixed day, we reached the station. We bought three tickets for Barishal.</p>
    <p>We sat in a row. The bus left for Barishal just at 11 a.m. The bus was moving on very swiftly.</p>
